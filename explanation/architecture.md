# JupyterHealth System Architecture

JupyterHealth is a modular ecosystem of interconnected components that enable patients to collect, control, and share their health data with researchers or clinicians. Users of JupyterHealth might include researchers or clinicians (or even patients) looking to combine patient-generated data with clinical data. This document explains the architecture of each component and how they work together to support patient-centered health data exchange.

## System Overview

The JupyterHealth ecosystem enables patients to share health data from personal medical devices with research studies through consent-based access control.

**Key Points**:

- **Device Manufacturers**: Patients' health devices sync data to manufacturer cloud APIs (glucose meters, CGMs, fitness trackers, smart rings)
- **CommonHealth App**: Retrieves data from manufacturers, transforms to IEEE 1752 standard, wraps in FHIR, uploads to JHE
- **JupyterHealth Exchange**: Manage organizations, practitioners, patients, studies, and consents
- **Researchers**: Query JHE FHIR API from Jupyter notebooks to analyze consented data

## Component Architecture

### 1. CommonHealth Android App

**Purpose**: Patient-facing mobile application for collecting health data from personal medical devices and uploading to JupyterHealth Exchange

**Role in System**:

CommonHealth serves as a data collection and consent management client for patients:

1. **Device Integration**: Connects to personal health devices and manufacturer APIs (glucose meters, continuous glucose monitors, fitness trackers, smart rings) as well as FHIR based APIs for clinical and insurance data
1. **Data Standardization**: Normalizes device data to Open mHealth (IEEE 1752) format
1. **FHIR Compatibility**: Packages standardized data as FHIR Observations for upload to JHE
1. **Consent Management**: Patient interface for enrolling in studies and managing data sharing consent
1. **Secure Communication**: Encrypted uploads to JHE via REST API

**Data Flow Example**:

```
Device Data → OMH Format → FHIR Observation → JupyterHealth Exchange
```

*Note: CommonHealth is developed by The Commons Project Foundation. For technical integration details, contact The Commons Project.*

### 2. JupyterHealth Exchange (Backend API)

**Technology**: Django, Django REST Framework, PostgreSQL

**Purpose**: Central data exchange hub managing patient data, consent, and research access

**Key Responsibilities**:

- Patient and practitioner management and authentication (OAuth 2.0)
- Organization and study management
- Consent management (granular, per-study, per-data-type)
- FHIR API for data upload and retrieval
- Role-based access control (Viewer, Member, Manager)
- Authorization enforcement (consent checks)

**Architecture Layers**:

    Auth[Authentication Layer<br/>OAuth 2.0]
    Authz[Authorization Layer<br/>RBAC + Consent Checks]

    Models[Data Models<br/>Django ORM]
    DB[(PostgreSQL Database)]

    style API fill:#fff3e0
    style Auth fill:#e8f5e9
    style Authz fill:#ffebee
    style FHIR fill:#e3f2fd
```

**Core Models**:

- `JHEUser`: Base user model (extends Django AbstractUser)
- `Patient`: Patient profile with FHIR Patient resource
- `Practitioner`: Researcher/clinician profile
- `Organization`: Research organizations with hierarchical structure
- `Study`: Clinical studies within organizations
- `Observation`: FHIR Observation resources (health data)
- `StudyPatient`: Many-to-many relationship (patients enrolled in studies)
- `StudyPatientScopeConsent`: Granular consent per patient, study, and data type
- `PractitionerOrganization`: Many-to-many with role (viewer/member/manager)

**Key Features**:

- FHIR compliance for Observation and Patient resources
- Multi-tenant organization structure
- Consent-as-authorization (no consent = no access)
- Study-level data scoping
- RESTful API with Django REST Framework

**API Endpoints**:

**Admin API:**

- `users` - Practitioner management
- `organizations` - Organization management
- `patients` - Patient management
- `studies` - Study management
- `observations` - Observation management
- `data_sources` - Data Source management

**FHIR API:**

- `base` - batch upload
- `Observation` - Observation search and create
- `Patient` - Patient search and create

### 3. Jupyter-SMART-on-FHIR Extension

**Technology**: Python, Jupyter, OAuth 2.0

**Purpose**: Enable researchers to authenticate with JHE from Jupyter notebooks

**Key Responsibilities**:

- OAuth 2.0 client configuration for SMART on FHIR
- Token acquisition and refresh
- Jupyter server integration
- Provide authenticated FHIR client for notebooks

**Workflow**:

    JHE->>J: Return consented data
```

**Configuration**:

- Set client ID and secret in `jupyter_server_config.py`
- Configure FHIR scopes (patient/*.read, observation/*.read)
- Set authorization and token endpoints

**Use Cases**:

- Data analysis on consented research data
- Machine learning model training
- Statistical analysis of study cohorts

## Deployment Architecture

### Local Development Deployment

For local development and testing, JupyterHealth Exchange can be run using Django's built-in development server:

**Setup Steps**:

1. Set up Python environment (Python >= 3.10)
1. Install dependencies: `pipenv sync` (or `pip install -r requirements.txt`)
1. Create PostgreSQL database
1. Copy `dot_env_example.txt` to `.env` and update database credentials
1. Load environment: `pipenv shell`
1. Run migrations: `python manage.py migrate`
1. Seed database: `python manage.py seed`
1. Start server: `python manage.py runserver`
1. Access at http://localhost:8000 with credentials `mary@example.com` / `Jhe1234!`

**Note**: The Django development server should only be used for local development, not production deployments.

## Interoperability Standards

### FHIR (Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources)

JupyterHealth uses FHIR as the primary data exchange format:

**FHIR Version**:

- **FHIR**: JupyterHealth Exchange uses FHIR exclusively

**FHIR Resources Implemented in JHE**:

- `Patient`: Patient demographics, identifiers, contact information
- `Observation`: Health measurements and device data (primary data resource)

JHE focuses specifically on device-generated observations rather than comprehensive EHR data.
